Loose breakdown of work, further information in Wireframing and flowcharts



1.        Welcome Page



\> HTML&CSS heavy, what users will see when they first arrive  

\> Should be ACCESSIBLE (font size, contrast, TTS)



2.        Account Creation - Kermann



\> Users will be able to create accounts  

\> Simple username and password system for now (communicates with dB)



3.        Account Login - Kermann



\> Should include options for recover/forgot password



\> Include option for creating acct if they don't have one



\> Should display an error if login info incorrect/can't be found



4.        Account Summary



\> Landing page after login



\> Should display current account balances to users



\> Emphasis on user's preferences about how they want the web pages to slow, will have to be flexible with this moving forward



\> Option to hide/censor amounts



5.        Cash Account(s)



\> Should have a list of transactions, can pull from database



\> Fairly simple, straightforward. How much was charged and by who/what business



6.        Stock Portfolio



\> Displays currently purchased stocks, as well as their current value



7.        Individual stock holding page



\> Show



8.        Buy Stock page



\> Click on a stock to go to its buy page



\> Select which account you would like to use money to buy stocks with



\> Purchases should reflect in the user's stock portfolio as well as reflect a charge in their account



9.        Stock Performance



\> Displays current value of various stock prices (i.e. "Apple is worth $1.234.56 today") with graph visual of historic prices (can be a dummy graph for presentation purposes)



\> Stocks will use a random number generator to create a price, will vary by day if possible



10.        “Real-time” stock data



- 1. \> May not be feasible, but we will see if we can integrate one with Fin hub stock



\> show live stocks of actual companies



\> We do not have to store these values, this would be more to show that we can connect an external/3rd party program within the functionality of our site



- 1. Contact Page/Inquire - Kermann



\> Submit/request form that should send an email to a dummy acct or have some internal way of showing that the request was received
